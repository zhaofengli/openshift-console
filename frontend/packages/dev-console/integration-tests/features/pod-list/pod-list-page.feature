Feature: Traffic Status details for pods
              As a administrator, I want to see whether a pod is receiving traffic or not.

        Background:
            Given user is at developer perspective
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-pods"
              And user is at Add page
              And user has created workload "nodejs-ex-git" with resource type "deployment"
              And user navigates to administrator perspective
              And user navigates to pods tab

        Scenario: Checking traffic status for pods in a project: P-01-TC01
             When user selects Receiving Traffic column to show in table
             Then user is able to see Receiving Traffic column in the list

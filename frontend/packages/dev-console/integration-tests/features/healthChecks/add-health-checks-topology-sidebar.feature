Feature: Perform Health Checks related Actions
              As a user, I should be able to perform Health Checks on workloads

        Background:
            Given user is at developer perspective
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-monitoring-sidebar"
              And user is at the Topology page

        Scenario: Add Health Checks page: HC-02-TC01
            Given workload "health-checks-d" with resource type "Deployment" is present in topology page
             When user clicks on the workload "health-checks-d" to open the sidebar
              And user selects "Add Health Checks" from topology sidebar Actions dropdown
             Then user will be redirected Add Health Checks page

        Scenario Outline: Add Health Checks to Deployments from Sidebar: HC-02-TC02
            Given workload "<workload_name>" with resource type "Deployment" is present in topology page
             When user searches and clicks on the workload "<workload_name>" to open the sidebar
              And user selects "Add Health Checks" from topology sidebar Actions dropdown
              And user clicks on Add Readiness Probe
              And user selects type as "<readinesss_type>"
              And user clicks on tick button
              And user clicks on Add Liveness Probe
              And user selects type as "<liveness_type>"

             Then user will be redirected to Topology page
              And user will see all 3 Probes added on the Add Health Checks page for "Deployment" "<workload_name>"
              And user can see workload "<workload_name>" in topology page

        Examples:
                  | workload_name | readinesss_type   | liveness_type     | startup_type      |
                  | http-d        | HTTP GET          | HTTP GET          | HTTP GET          |
